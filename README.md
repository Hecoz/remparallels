**Update:** [Milestone 2.0](https://github.com/danijeljames/remparallels/issues?milestone=1&state=open) created for release at later stage.

# Remove Parallels from OS X

Licence: MIT  
Copyright: Danijel J
Year: 2013 


Formerely known as "Remove Parallels All Versions". Renamed because I fixed up the original script, compiled an AppleScript that does the hard work for you, and then bundled it into a self-contained Mac OSX app.  Now has a feature that will save your **Parallels** licence to the desktop in a folder with a Readme file so you don't forget what it is.

####Update:

Added a zipped version of the App to make distribution easier.


####Usage:


**Original Script**  
    $ chmod +x remprls.sh    
    $ ./remprls.sh  
  
**Mac App**  
    Double click "Remove Parallels.app"  


#### Requires:

Sudo access to be able to run.
