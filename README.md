Remove Parallels from OS X
==========================

Licence: MIT  
Copyright: Danijel J  


Formerely known as "Remove Parallels All Versions". Renamed because I fixed up the original script, compiled an AppleScript that does the hard work for you, and then bundled it into a self-contained Mac OSX app.  Now has a feature that will save your *Parallels* licence to the desktop in a folder with a Readme file so you don't forget what it is.


Usage:
-----

**Original Script**
$ chmod +x remprls.sh    
$ ./remprls.sh  
  
**Mac App**  
Double click "Remove Parallels.app"  


Requires:
---------
Sudo access to be able to run.
